* org-gtasks — Heading-level sync between Org and Google Tasks

Fork of [[https://github.com/JulienMasson/org-gtasks][JulienMasson/org-gtasks]], rewritten for heading-level sync.

Unlike the original, this version does *not* create or own org files.
Instead it syncs individual TODO headings (matched by =:GTASKS_ID:= property)
within your existing org files.

** How it works

Two Google Tasks lists are used:

- *Push list* (default: "org") — Emacs pushes your active TODOs here so you can
  see and complete them from the Google Tasks phone app.
- *Pull list* (default: "inbox") — Tasks you create on your phone get pulled
  into your =inbox.org= as new TODO items.

Completing a task on your phone marks it DONE in org on next sync.

** Setup

1. In your [[https://console.developers.google.com/][Google Cloud Console]] project (the same one you use for org-gcal),
   enable the *Tasks API*.

2. Add to your Emacs config:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! org-gtasks
  :after org
  :config
  (org-gtasks-register-account
   :name "work"
   :login "you@example.com"
   :client-id "your-client-id"
   :client-secret "your-client-secret"
   :push-tasklist "org"       ; Google Tasks list name for pushed TODOs
   :pull-tasklist "inbox"     ; Google Tasks list name for phone capture
   :inbox-file "~/org/inbox.org"
   :agenda-files-fn (lambda () org-agenda-files)))
#+end_src

3. Run =M-x org-gtasks-sync= — on first run it will open a browser for OAuth.

** Commands

| Command                    | Description                                           |
|----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| =org-gtasks-sync=          | Bidirectional: pull phone tasks, then push org TODOs  |
| =org-gtasks-push=          | Push org TODOs → Google Tasks                         |
| =org-gtasks-pull=          | Pull Google Tasks → org inbox                         |
| =org-gtasks-clear-completed= | Remove completed tasks from the push list (declutter) |

** Properties

Each synced heading gets a =:GTASKS_ID:= property linking it to the
Google Tasks API. Don't edit this manually.

** Limitations

- Google Tasks only supports: title, notes, due date, status (done/not done).
  Org priorities, tags, SCHEDULED vs DEADLINE, etc. don't round-trip.
- The push list shows a flat view of TODOs — no project grouping.
- DONE-refile hooks in Emacs won't fire for tasks completed on the phone
  (the heading is simply marked DONE in-place on next sync).
